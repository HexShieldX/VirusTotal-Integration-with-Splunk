                                                         **VirusTotal Integration with Splunk**

**Overview**

This project demonstrates how to integrate VirusTotal threat intelligence with Splunk. The integration allows automatic querying of VirusTotal for file hashes, URLs, or IPs, and enriches Splunk logs with threat intelligence data. This helps security analysts detect malware, phishing URLs, or suspicious files in real time.

**Features**

1. Query VirusTotal API for file hashes, URLs, and IPs
2. Enrich Splunk logs with threat intelligence results
3. Real-time alerts for malicious activity
4. Dashboard visualization of threats in Splunk
5. Automates threat detection and investigation

**Tech Stack**

a.  VirusTotal API
b.  Splunk Enterprise / Splunk Cloud
c.  Python / Splunk scripts / REST API
d.  JSON for data formatting

**Usage**
1. Obtain a VirusTotal API key.
2. Configure Splunk to run scripts or use the REST API to query VirusTotal.
3. Enrich incoming logs in Splunk with VirusTotal results.
4. Create dashboards or alerts based on threat intelligence
